# nosql-challenge

The goal of this challenge was to setup a Mongo Database, a no-SQL application. The challenge has two parts:

Part One - Setup and Update

In this part, we setup the mongo database and then updated the database by adding another document. 

Part Two - Analysis

This part focused on analysis on the database. We answered the following questions using queries and the results were converted into a pandas dataframe:

Which establishments have a hygiene score equal to 20?
Which establishments in London have a RatingValue greater than or equal to 4?
What are the top 5 establishments with a rating value of '5', sorted by lowest hygiene score, nearest to the new restaurant added, "Penang Flavours"?
How many establishments in each Local Authority area have a hygiene score of 0?
